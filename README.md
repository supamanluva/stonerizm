### What is this?

A fully procedural audio-visual experience built with **WebGL** and the **Web Audio API**. No samples, no loops — every note, every drum hit, every visual frame is generated in real-time by code.

### 🦣 Stoner Doom Mode
- Realistic tube amp guitar with cabinet simulation & spring reverb
- Heavy Drop D bass with overdrive
- Thundering doom drums with room reverb
- Slow, crushing riffs at 38-46 BPM

### 🚀 Space Rock / Krautrock Mode
- Mellotron-style pads with tape wobble
- Sequenced arpeggios with resonant filter sweeps
- Phaser & chorus effects
- Cosmic delay lines at 68-80 BPM

### Genre Crossfading
The music automatically transitions between stoner doom and space rock across multi-section songs. Visuals morph in sync — doom reds/oranges fade into cosmic blues/purples with nebula warps and aurora streaks.
